## ⚒️ Main Process

## Exploring the Dataset

### 🔍 Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month)

In this first query, I summarize the website’s performance for **January, February, and March 2017** by aggregating key session metrics at the monthly level. Specifically, I calculate the total number of **visits, pageviews,** and **transactions** for each month to establish a baseline view of traffic volume and purchasing activity. Grouping by month makes it easier to compare month-to-month changes and quickly spot any early trends in engagement and conversion before diving into deeper source and funnel analyses later in the project.

### 🔍 Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017

In this query, I measure **bounce rate** for each traffic source in **July 2017** to evaluate traffic quality and landing-page fit. By comparing the share of bounced sessions across sources, I can distinguish channels that bring **more engaged visitors** from those that drive quick exits. This helps pinpoint where to focus optimization—either by improving landing page experience for high-bounce sources or by refining targeting and acquisition strategies to attract users with higher intent.

### 🔍 Revenue by traffic source by week, by month in June 2017

In this query, I calculate **revenue generated by each traffic source** in **June 2017**, then break it down by both **week** and **month** to capture short-term fluctuations and overall monthly performance. This view helps reveal which channels consistently drive the most revenue versus those with spikes or volatility, supporting smarter decisions around **budget allocation** , **campaign timing**, and channel-specific optimization to sustain revenue growth.

### 🔍 Average number of pageviews by purchaser type (purchasers vs non-purchasers) in June, July 2017.

This query compares the **average number of pageviews** between **purchasers** and **non-purchasers** to understand how engagement differs across user types. By separating users based on whether they completed a transaction, I can identify how much browsing typically happens before a purchase and whether low-engagement sessions are unlikely to convert. These insights help guide improvements in content/UX (to encourage deeper exploration) and support strategies to move non-purchasers further down the conversion journey.

### 🔍 Average number of transactions per user that made a purchase in July 2017

In this query, I calculate the **average number of transactions per user** among those who made at least one purchase in **July 2017**. This metric helps describe purchasing frequency and highlights whether revenue is driven mainly by **one-time buyers** or by users who return and buy multiple times within the same period. Understanding this pattern supports retention-focused actions such as loyalty offers, remarketing to recent buyers, and targeted campaigns aimed at increasing repeat purchases.

### 🔍 Average amount of money spent per session. Only include purchaser data in July 2017

This query estimates the **average amount spent per session** for users who completed a purchase in **July 2017**. By focusing only on purchaser sessions, the metric reflects the typical **monetary value of a converting visit**, helping differentiate between high-intent sessions and general browsing traffic. The result can be used to evaluate marketing effectiveness (are campaigns driving valuable sessions?) and to support strategies that target or retain **high-value customers**.

### 🔍 Other products purchased by customers who purchased product "YouTube Men's Vintage Henley" in July 2017. Output should show product name and the quantity was ordered.

In this query, I identify **other products purchased** by customers who bought "**YouTube Men's Vintage Henley**" in **July 2017**, and summarize the quantity ordered for each additional product. This analysis helps uncover co-purchase patterns and highlights potential **cross-selling bundles** or recommendation opportunities (e.g., “frequently bought together”). The results can support merchandising decisions and targeted promotions to increase basket size and overall revenue.

### 🔍 Calculate cohort map from product view to addtocart to purchase in Jan, Feb and March 2017. For example, 100% product view then 40% add_to_cart and 10% purchase.

This query builds a funnel cohort map to track how users progress from **product view** to **add-to-cart** and ultimately to **purchase** across **January, February, and March 2017**. By measuring the volume and conversion rate at each step, I can pinpoint where users drop off in the journey and identify the stages with the biggest friction. These insights support funnel optimization efforts such as improving product page clarity, strengthening add-to-cart incentives, and streamlining the checkout experience to increase overall conversion.

### 🔎 Final Conclusion & Recommendations  

👉🏻 Based on the analyses above, here are the key takeaways and recommended actions for stakeholders (Marketing / E-commerce / Product teams):

### ✅ Key Takeaways
- Traffic quality differs by source/medium: some channels drive high visits but also higher bounce rates.
- Purchasers show stronger engagement than non purchasers(e.g, more pageviews) before converting.
- The funnel highlights clear drop-offs across steps (view -> add_to_cart -> purchase), indicating friction points.

### 🎯 Recommendations
- Prioritize high-performing sources and optimize/retarget high-bounce sources (landing page + targeting).
- Improve key funnel stages: enhance product pages (view -> cart) and reduce checkout friction (cart -> purchase)
- Use cross-sell tactics (bundles / "frequently bought together") to increase average order value.
